Project Title: ASAP Task Manager

Project Overview:

ASAP Task Manager is a web application designed to help users efficiently manage and track their tasks, set deadlines, and organize their to-do lists. The project will involve creating a full-stack application with an API and a frontend that allows users to interact with their tasks, including creating, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks. This project will integrate several key technologies, from backend server setup to frontend development, and it will also provide a learning opportunity to understand deployment, testing, and database interaction.

Key Features:

Task CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and securely manage their sessions.
Task Assignment & Deadline Setting: Assign tasks to users and set deadlines.
Responsive UI: A simple, user-friendly interface to manage tasks.
User Role Management (Optional): Admins can assign tasks to users.
Data Persistence: Tasks and user data are stored in a database and persist across sessions.
API Testing: Use of an API client to interact with backend APIs.
Frontend-Backend Integration: React frontend and Express backend connected seamlessly.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Vite for fast development and hot-reloading), Tailwind CSS (for styling).
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (API creation and routing).
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose (for data storage and management).
Authentication: Passport.js (or Firebase Auth for optional authentication).
Deployment: Vercel for frontend and Heroku (or Railway) for backend deployment.
Testing Tools: Postman for API testing.
Version Control: GitHub for version control and project management.
Optional: Docker for containerization, Firebase Auth for authentication, background jobs with Node.js, and SSR (Server-Side Rendering) using React.

Why This Project:

This project was chosen because it involves building a full-stack web application with both frontend and backend development, allowing me to showcase a broad set of skills. The ASAP Task Manager project will allow me to learn how to create, deploy, and test APIs, while also developing the front end to interact with the API. Key learning goals include setting up a development environment, using GitHub for version control, understanding Mongoose for schema design, and working with database connections. The project also includes optional features such as Firebase authentication, background jobs, and containerization, making it an excellent opportunity to learn more advanced topics.

Working on this project will strengthen my skills in:

Full-stack web development (both frontend and backend).
API creation and database management with Express and MongoDB.
React development for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
Deployment and testing of web applications.
Security best practices for handling user data (passwords, sessions).
